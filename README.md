#Section 508 - Accessibility Testing 
##Welcome to Section 508 What is it and Why it is Important to You?
When it comes to making sure persons with disabilities have equal access to Information and Communication Technology (ICT), everyone can make a difference.

When the Federal government "develops, procures, maintains, or uses" ICT, it must meet the Revised Section 508 Standards. Inaccessible ICT prevents employees and customers with disabilities from doing their jobs, or interacting with the Federal government. Conformance with these standards is mandated by Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.

Whether you are creating documents, designing presentations, buying or building ICT products or services, or supporting ICT, it is important for you to understand your Section 508 related responsibilities so you can do your part.

When you've completed this course, you should be able to:

- Explain what Section 508 is and why it is important
- Explain how Section 508 conformance can make ICT more accessible to persons with disabilities
- Explain how inaccessible ICT impacts persons with disabilities
- List job-related responsibilities for meeting Section 508 Standards
- List available resources to help you meet Section 508 Standards
