# Section 508 - Accessibility Testing INTRODUCTION
## Welcome to Section 508 What is it and Why it is Important to You?
When it comes to making sure persons with disabilities have equal access to Information and Communication Technology (ICT), everyone can make a difference.

When the Federal government "develops, procures, maintains, or uses" ICT, it must meet the Revised Section 508 Standards. Inaccessible ICT prevents employees and customers with disabilities from doing their jobs, or interacting with the Federal government. Conformance with these standards is mandated by Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.

Whether you are creating documents, designing presentations, buying or building ICT products or services, or supporting ICT, it is important for you to understand your Section 508 related responsibilities so you can do your part.

When you've completed this course, you should be able to:

- Explain what Section 508 is and why it is important
- Explain how Section 508 conformance can make ICT more accessible to persons with disabilities
- Explain how inaccessible ICT impacts persons with disabilities
- List job-related responsibilities for meeting Section 508 Standards
- List available resources to help you meet Section 508 Standards

# What is Section 508?
## So what exactly is Section 508? When does it apply? To whom does it apply?
Section 508 affects many different people, in many roles, and in many different parts of the organization. As a Federal employee or contractor, you may be responsible for Section 508 compliance that aligns with your role in the organization.

This lesson provides a general description of the Section 508 Standards and explains the types of products and services that must meet those standards.

When you've completed the lesson you will be able to:

- Define Section 508
- Define Information and Communication Technology (ICT)
- Identify the scope of the Section 508 standards
- List the specific activities covered by Section 508

### Section 508 Defined
>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended is a set of standards that requires Federal agencies to make ICT accessible to employees and members of the public who have disabilities in a comparable manner to the access experienced by employees and members of the public without disabilities.

The revised Section 508 Standards apply to ICT that is “procured, developed, maintained, or used” by agencies of the Federal government. Section 508 was enacted to eliminate barriers to ICT, make opportunities available for persons with disabilities, and encourage development of technologies that will help achieve these goals.

---
### ICT Defined
>ICT includes information technology and other equipment, systems, technologies, or processes, for which the principal function is the creation, manipulation, storage, display, receipt, or transmission of electronic data and information, as well as any associated content.
#### ICT Examples
Examples of ICT include but are not limited to:

- Computers and peripheral equipment
- Information kiosks and transaction machines
- Telecommunications equipment (telephones, telephone systems)
- Customer premises equipment (servers, routers)
- Multifunction office machines
- Software, applications, and websites
- Videos
- Electronic documents

This wide range of commonly used products must be accessible to persons with disabilities, including:

- Desktop and mobile telephones and other telecommunications products that interact with users in real time
- Information kiosks and booths that provide information in public places such as Federal buildings and hospitals
- Documents that are posted to the Internet (e.g., PDF, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint)
- Multifunction machines that scan, fax, print, etc.
- Websites including content accessed from the Internet and on private networks
- Computer software and hardware including desktop systems and mobile systems such as laptops and other mobile computers

### Application, Administration and Scope of Section 508
The application, administration, and scope of Section 508 are defined in the first two chapters of the Revised Section 508 Standards.

>The Revised Section 508 Standards replace the original product-based Section 508 Standards with an approach based on ICT functions. The revised technical requirements, which are organized along the lines of ICT functionality, provide requirements to ensure that covered hardware, software, electronic content, and support documentation and services are accessible to people with disabilities.

Technological advances over the past two decades have resulted in the widespread use of multifunction devices. Consequently, one of the primary purposes of the Revised Section 508 Standards is to replace the current product-based approach with requirements based on functionality, and, thereby, ensure that accessibility for people with disabilities keeps pace with advances in ICT.

---
### Section 508 Standards Content Overview
>>Appendix A applies only to Section 508-covered ICT and consists of 508 Chapter 1, which sets forth general application and administration provisions, and 508 Chapter 2, which contains scoping requirements (that prescribe which ICT – and, in some cases, how many – must comply with the technical specifications).

>>Appendix C sets forth technical specifications that apply equally to ICT covered under Sections 508. Appendix C includes five chapters, each of which (with the exception of the final chapter) addresses a separate ICT functional area.

The Chapters are : 
- [Chapter 3: Funtional Performance Criteria](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/final-rule/text-of-the-standards-and-guidelines#301-general)
- [Chapter 4: Hardware](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/final-rule/text-of-the-standards-and-guidelines#401-general)
- [Chapter 5: Software](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/final-rule/text-of-the-standards-and-guidelines#501-general)
- [Chapter 6: Support Documentation and Services](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/final-rule/text-of-the-standards-and-guidelines#601-general)
- [Chapter 7: Referenced Standards](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/final-rule/text-of-the-standards-and-guidelines#701-general)

### Functional Performance Criteria
Functional performance criteria support the needs of users with:

1. Blindness or visual impairments.
2. Deafness, hearing impairments, or use of assistive hearing devices.
3. Difficulty with speech.
4. Difficulty with fine motor control.
5. Limited reach and strength.

>Functional performance criteria are used to evaluate the accessibility of ICT when clearly defined requirements are either not available, cannot be developed in a timely manner, fail to adequately assess accessibility, or when the technical requirements outlined in Chapter 4: Hardware or Chapter 5: Software do not address all of the features of the ICT.

The intent of the standard is to never prevent the technology industry from offering innovative solutions that might allow for equivalent or even greater accessibility. This is referred to as equivalent facilitation. Functional performance criteria can be used to evaluate accessibility for innovative products when existing technical requirements do not apply.

---
### Equivalent Facilitation
The use of an alternate design or technology that results in substantially equivalent of greater accessibility and usability by individuals with disabilities than would be provided by conformance to one of more of the requirements in Chapter 4: Hardware and Chapter 5: Software is permitted.

The Functional Performance Criteria in Chapter 3 shall be used to determine whether substantially equivalent or greater accessibility and usability is provided to individuals with disabilities.

---
### Broad Application of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0
The Revised 508 Standards incorporate by reference the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, a globally-recognized and technologically-neutral set of accessibility guidelines for web content.

For Section 508-covered ICT, all covered web and non-web content and software (such as websites, intranets, word processing documents, PDF documents, project management software, etc.) is required, with a few specific exceptions, to conform to WCAG 2.0’s Level A and Level AA Success Criteria and Conformance Requirements.

By applying a single set of requirements to websites, electronic documents, and software, the revised requirements adapt the existing Section 508 Standards to reflect the newer multifunction technologies (e.g., smartphones that have telecommunications functions, video cameras, and computer-like data processing capabilities) and address the accessibility challenges that these technologies pose for individuals with disabilities.

---
### Delineation of Covered Electronic “Content”
The Revised Section 508 Standards specify that all types of public-facing content, as well as nine categories of non-public-facing content that communicate agency official business, have to be accessible. “Content,” as defined in the standards, encompasses all forms of electronic information and data.

The existing standards required Federal agencies to make electronic information and data accessible but did not delineate clearly the scope of covered information and data. As a result, document accessibility has been inconsistent across Federal agencies.

By focusing on public-facing content and certain types of agency official communications that are not public facing, the revised requirements bring needed clarity to the scope of electronic content covered by the Section 508 Standards and, thereby, help Federal agencies make electronic content more consistently accessible.

---
### Interoperability Requirements
The Section 508 Standards provide specific requirements that detail how operating systems, software development toolkits, and software applications should interact with assistive technology (AT) – that is, hardware or software that increases or maintains functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities (e.g., screen magnifiers or refreshable braille displays). However, the Section 508 standards themselves do not apply to AT products and services.

---
### What ICT Activities are Covered?
By now you should have a good understanding of what ICT is and the types of ICT that are covered under Section 508. The standards also detail when they apply. Federal agencies are subject to Section 508 Standards during four specific ICT-related activities:

- Development
- Procurement
- Maintenance
- Use
Even though you may not be involved in any of these activities right now, it’s important to understand what they are and how Section 508 applies to them. The information will be useful if your current role changes or if you move to a position where you’re involved in these types of activities on behalf of the government.

---
### Development of ICT
When a new product or service is being created, it is the responsibility of everyone involved to address Section 508 Standards during the planning, design, and development processes. The entire team (including project managers, user interface designers, programmers, developers, and possibly instructional designers) is responsible for developing a product that meets the Section 508 Standards.

Development can take many shapes, such as:

- Software
- Websites
- Hardware
- Documents

---
### ICT Accessibility Examples

>An agency wants to provide customers with a way to access personal medical information from mobile and desktop software. A new website with applications that provide personal privacy is built by a contracted company. Since the new website and applications are ICT provided by a Federal agency, they must meet the Revised Section 508 Standards.

>A supervisor sends his assistant a financial report in PDF format and asks him to distribute it to the entire department. Because this document supports the agency's mission, the assistant should determine if the document is accessible before sending it out as an email attachment.

>A national park owned and managed by the Federal government creates new information kiosks for several locations along a scenic walking path. The kiosks are used to point out special attractions along the way. Since the park is owned by the Federal government and the new kiosks are considered ICT, they must meet the Section 508 Standards.

---
### Procurement of ICT
When you procure products and services for a government agency, you have the responsibility to procure ICT that meets the Section 508 Standards. Below are some examples of ICT procurement needs.

>You have been asked to procure a new help desk system for your agency. Because that help desk system will be used by employees of a Federal agency, you must procure the most compliant product available that meets your agency’s business needs.

>The department’s multifunction machine has stopped working and cannot be repaired. You have the authority to procure replacement equipment locally. As an employee of a Federal agency, you must make sure the new multifunction machine is the most conformant device available today that meets your business needs.

>Your agency wants to procure mobile devices for field staff so they can submit inspection reports quickly and easily. You must make sure that the mobile devices, along with the software loaded on them, are the most conformant products available today that meet your business needs.
