# Section 508 - Accessibility Testing INTRODUCTION
## Welcome to Section 508 What is it and Why it is Important to You?
When it comes to making sure persons with disabilities have equal access to Information and Communication Technology (ICT), everyone can make a difference.

When the Federal government "develops, procures, maintains, or uses" ICT, it must meet the Revised Section 508 Standards. Inaccessible ICT prevents employees and customers with disabilities from doing their jobs, or interacting with the Federal government. Conformance with these standards is mandated by Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.

Whether you are creating documents, designing presentations, buying or building ICT products or services, or supporting ICT, it is important for you to understand your Section 508 related responsibilities so you can do your part.

When you've completed this course, you should be able to:

- Explain what Section 508 is and why it is important
- Explain how Section 508 conformance can make ICT more accessible to persons with disabilities
- Explain how inaccessible ICT impacts persons with disabilities
- List job-related responsibilities for meeting Section 508 Standards
- List available resources to help you meet Section 508 Standards

# What is Section 508?
## So what exactly is Section 508? When does it apply? To whom does it apply?
Section 508 affects many different people, in many roles, and in many different parts of the organization. As a Federal employee or contractor, you may be responsible for Section 508 compliance that aligns with your role in the organization.

This lesson provides a general description of the Section 508 Standards and explains the types of products and services that must meet those standards.

When you've completed the lesson you will be able to:

- Define Section 508
- Define Information and Communication Technology (ICT)
- Identify the scope of the Section 508 standards
- List the specific activities covered by Section 508

### Section 508 Defined
>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended is a set of standards that requires Federal agencies to make ICT accessible to employees and members of the public who have disabilities in a comparable manner to the access experienced by employees and members of the public without disabilities.

The revised Section 508 Standards apply to ICT that is “procured, developed, maintained, or used” by agencies of the Federal government. Section 508 was enacted to eliminate barriers to ICT, make opportunities available for persons with disabilities, and encourage development of technologies that will help achieve these goals.

### ICT Defined
>ICT includes information technology and other equipment, systems, technologies, or processes, for which the principal function is the creation, manipulation, storage, display, receipt, or transmission of electronic data and information, as well as any associated content.
#### ICT Examples
Examples of ICT include but are not limited to:

- Computers and peripheral equipment
- Information kiosks and transaction machines
- Telecommunications equipment (telephones, telephone systems)
- Customer premises equipment (servers, routers)
- Multifunction office machines
- Software, applications, and websites
- Videos
- Electronic documents

This wide range of commonly used products must be accessible to persons with disabilities, including:

- Desktop and mobile telephones and other telecommunications products that interact with users in real time
- Information kiosks and booths that provide information in public places such as Federal buildings and hospitals
- Documents that are posted to the Internet (e.g., PDF, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint)
- Multifunction machines that scan, fax, print, etc.
- Websites including content accessed from the Internet and on private networks
- Computer software and hardware including desktop systems and mobile systems such as laptops and other mobile computers

### Application, Administration and Scope of Section 508
The application, administration, and scope of Section 508 are defined in the first two chapters of the Revised Section 508 Standards.

>The Revised Section 508 Standards replace the original product-based Section 508 Standards with an approach based on ICT functions. The revised technical requirements, which are organized along the lines of ICT functionality, provide requirements to ensure that covered hardware, software, electronic content, and support documentation and services are accessible to people with disabilities.

Technological advances over the past two decades have resulted in the widespread use of multifunction devices. Consequently, one of the primary purposes of the Revised Section 508 Standards is to replace the current product-based approach with requirements based on functionality, and, thereby, ensure that accessibility for people with disabilities keeps pace with advances in ICT.

### Section 508 Standards Content Overview
>>Appendix A applies only to Section 508-covered ICT and consists of 508 Chapter 1, which sets forth general application and administration provisions, and 508 Chapter 2, which contains scoping requirements (that prescribe which ICT – and, in some cases, how many – must comply with the technical specifications).

>>Appendix C sets forth technical specifications that apply equally to ICT covered under Sections 508. Appendix C includes five chapters, each of which (with the exception of the final chapter) addresses a separate ICT functional area.

The Chapters are : 
- [Chapter 3: Funtional Performance Criteria](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/final-rule/text-of-the-standards-and-guidelines#301-general)
- [Chapter 4: Hardware](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/final-rule/text-of-the-standards-and-guidelines#401-general)
- [Chapter 5: Software](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/final-rule/text-of-the-standards-and-guidelines#501-general)
- [Chapter 6: Support Documentation and Services](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/final-rule/text-of-the-standards-and-guidelines#601-general)
- [Chapter 7: Referenced Standards](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/final-rule/text-of-the-standards-and-guidelines#701-general)

### Functional Performance Criteria
Functional performance criteria support the needs of users with:

1. Blindness or visual impairments.
2. Deafness, hearing impairments, or use of assistive hearing devices.
3. Difficulty with speech.
4. Difficulty with fine motor control.
5. Limited reach and strength.

>Functional performance criteria are used to evaluate the accessibility of ICT when clearly defined requirements are either not available, cannot be developed in a timely manner, fail to adequately assess accessibility, or when the technical requirements outlined in Chapter 4: Hardware or Chapter 5: Software do not address all of the features of the ICT.

The intent of the standard is to never prevent the technology industry from offering innovative solutions that might allow for equivalent or even greater accessibility. This is referred to as equivalent facilitation. Functional performance criteria can be used to evaluate accessibility for innovative products when existing technical requirements do not apply.
